R10.5 An event object is an object that is instantiated from one of the classes that passes information between an event source and an event
listener.  The event source is the user-interface component, such as a button, that generates a particular event.  The event listeners objects
process events that are passed to them and provide methods to act when they are triggered.

R10.6 When an action is performed, the Java event handling library calls listener.actionPerformed(event).  The call to the actionPerformed
method occurs when an event happens.

R10.11 Inner classes are useful for listener classes for two reasons--first, because listener classes tend to be very short so they can be
incorporated very succinctly.  Secondly, they are useful because the inner class can access all the instance variables and methods of the
outer class.  It would be possible to implement the listener as a regular class, but it is unnattractive because the listener would need
to be constructed with a reference to the label field.

R10.14 A method JTextArea implements is "void append(Str string)," it appends the given text to the end of the document.  A method JTextArea
inherits from JTextComponent is "public void copy()," which transfers the currently selected range in the associated text model to the system
clipboard, leaving the contents in the text model. A methodJTextArea inherits from Jcomponent is "public void
removeAncestorListener(AncestorListener listener)," which unregisters listener so that it will no longer receive AncestorEvents.

R10.22 To change the color to any other color you would alter the code in Step 3-- g.setColor(Color.GREEN) and g.SetColor(Color.RED) to
whichever arbitrary colors on the left and right.

R11.2 The advantage of using a layout manager is that there are some general zones that are defined so the programmer doesn't have to
do as much trial and error to get the compononets of a frame arranged in a pleasing way.

R11.11 A ButtonGroup is necessary for radio buttons but not for check boxes because radio buttons are mutually exclusive (only one can be
selected) while check boxes are not.

R11.19 An ActionEvent is a simpler event than a MouseEvent.  The action listener only has one method, to respond when the action has been
performed, as compared with the MouseEvent that has methods to respond to click, press, release, entered, and exited.

R11.20 An ActionEvent object:
String getActionCommand -- a string that can be set.
int getModifiers-- an int that returns the keys that were used to trigger the event
Object getSource-- the Object that triggered the event.

The MouseEvent also carries information about the x and y position on the screen and whether any buttons have changed their state as a result
of the action.

R11.21 The action listener has only one method because it listens to a single event, while a mouse click is more complicated because it depends
on the position of the mouse as well as the combination of buttons pressed so it has more methods to capture the additional complexity.
